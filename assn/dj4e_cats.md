Cats CRUD
=========

This assignment is to build a fully working CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete)
application to manage cats and their breeds (i.e. Tabby, Persian, Main Coon,
Siamese, Manx, etc.).

This application will be in effect a clone of of your previous assigment but different. 
You will use your autos assignment as a prototype for this cats assignment.
