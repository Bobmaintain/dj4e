Django Sessions
===============

In this assignment we will add  a few lines of code to demonstrate sessions.

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Django/Sessions

The sessions tutorial is simple enough that it needs no further explanation.

Make sure to reload your application under the `Web` tab in
<a href="https://www.pythonanywhere.com" target="_blank">PythonAnywhere</a> whenever you change the `views.py` file.

If You Are Keeping Your Projects GitHub
---------------------------------------

At this point, once your models are working, you might want to add the new files
and check your modifications into github.

    cd ~/django_projects/locallibrary/catalog
    git status
    git commit -a -m "Sessions tutorial complete"
    git push

You might also want to tag this version of the code in case you need to come back to it:

    git tag sessions
    git push origin --tags
