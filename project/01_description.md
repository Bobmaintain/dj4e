Milestone 1: Describe Your Project
==================================

For this milestone, you will write a 1-2 paragraph summary of your project idea.
Make sure to mention the following:

* If you are basing the project on a data set, give the data set you have found or the kind of data set you are looking for.  If you are thinking of building something similar to an existing data-backed site, linclude which site(s) you are looking at.

* If you are building a social site, describe what site is most similar and what features you are thinking about building.  Pay particular attendion to how you will avoid scope creep.

* If you are building a 'public facing" web site for an organization, tell us the kind of site you are looking to build andwhat kind of user-entered material you hope to have on your site.

Keep it short, to the point and easily readible.   This proposal does not lock you down, you can change your mind later.  The goal is just to get started with your thinking about the project as early as possible.
