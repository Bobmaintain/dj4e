Milestone 2: Revised Description
================================

For this milestone, you will revise your 1-2 paragraph summary of your project idea and add a short paragraph
describing what the changes are and why you are making the changes.  If you are not making any changes briefly
describe anything you have learned or improved on your description.

* If you are basing the project on a data set, give the data set you have found or the kind of data set you are looking for.  If you are thinking of building something similar to an existing data-backed site, linclude which site(s) you are looking at.

* If you are building a social site, describe what site is most similar and what features you are thinking about building.  Pay particular attendion to how you will avoid scope creep.

* If you are building a 'public facing" web site for an organization, tell us the kind of site you are looking to build andwhat kind of user-entered material you hope to have on your site.

Keep it short, to the point and easily readible.   This proposal still does not lock you down, you can change your mind later.  The goal is just to get started with your thinking about the project as early as possible.

Please be honest about how you came up with the revision.   It is OK ot have talked to someone, showed your ideas to someone,
or did some testing and found a problem, or just through about it more.  It is good to get a lot of input from lots of people
when "brainstorming" about a potential project.
